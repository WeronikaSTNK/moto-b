## This project is for commercial use. This is a motorcycle rental site for a friend.
 ## Visit: https://motob2.netlify.com

Technology & tools I use:
- react.js,
- context API,
- responsive web design,
- react-router-dom (just for authorization),
- SPA,
- SASS.

## In addition, I am currently working on motorcycle reservations directly from the site and administrator authorization. The backend part is made by my friend using Java and Spring.
